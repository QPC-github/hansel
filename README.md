# Hansel

Hansel generates empty linux packages. These packages can be installed to track dependencies manually added.

The name is inspired by:
* [Hansel and Gretel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hansel_and_Gretel), as the packages are breadcrumbs left for a container scanner to locate.
* [Owen Wilson's character in Zoolander](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV_hDyfmEw4), as supply chain observability is "so hot right now".
